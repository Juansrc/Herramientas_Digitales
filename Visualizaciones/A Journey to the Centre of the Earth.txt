A Journey to the Centre of the Earth: In Hamburg, Professor Lidenbrock lives with his nephew Axel and his girlfriend Graüben. One day, the professor discovers an ancient manuscript from the 16th century that tells how to reach the center of the earth. To do this, they must enter the crater of the Snæfellsjökull volcano in Iceland. The professor embarks on the expedition with Alex and Hans Bjelke, an Icelandic guide. The first few days they experience problems such as the lack of water, the dark tunnels and the vicissitudes of the terrain. As they enter the center of the earth, they encounter dazzling landscapes, huge fossils, a forest of mushrooms, a battle between sea monsters and giant caverns. Axel gets lost from the group, but his companions manage to find him and continue the expedition. It all comes to an end when a volcanic eruption pushes them to the surface of the Estromboli volcano in Italy. Back on land, they return to Germany stunned by the experience.
